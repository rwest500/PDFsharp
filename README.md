## Read this FIRST

Project documentation can be found on our DOCS site: <https://docs.pdfsharp.net>.

### Download assets first

Assets like bitmaps, fonts, or PDF files are not part of the repository anymore.
You must download them before compiling the solution for the first time.
Use `download-assets.ps1` in the `dev` folder to create `assets` folder required for some unit tests and needed by some projects.

Execute `.\dev\download-assets.ps1`

### Build the solution

`dotnet build` should build the solution without any warnings or errors.

* You need the latest .NET SDK version installed
* If you got an exception from `GitVersion.MsBuild` let us know.  
  You can set a tag to define a valid version, e.g.: `git tag v6.0.0` to make it work.

### Central package management

The solution uses central package management.
Version numbers for all referenced packages are stored in file `Directory.Packages.props` in the `src` folder.
When adding new packages, add the required version here.
