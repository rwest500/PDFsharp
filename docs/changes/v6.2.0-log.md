### PDFsharp 6.2.0 Preview 1

#### Features

**Digital signatures**  
PDF documents can now be signed with a digital signature.

**Multi-colored glyphs**  
Multi-colored glyphs like emojis are now supported.

**.NET Framework 4.6.2**  
All assemblies have downgraded .NET Framework references in `<TargetFrameworks>` from 4.7.2 to 4.6.2.  
`net472` becomes `net462`.

**.NET 8**  
We added .NET 8 (`net8.0`) to `<TargetFrameworks>`.

**PDF/A**  
PDF documents can now be PDF/A conforming. We are still working on this feature, so currently there are some limitations.

#### Bug fixes

**Cleanup NuGet packages**  
MigraDoc packages now depend on PDFsharp NuGet packages instead of including assemblies directly.
All packages now depend on e.g. `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` instead of including the Microsoft assembly.

**.restext files removed**  
Some assemblies had a subfolder `de` containing German messages.
We removed all `.restext` resources. All messages are now available in US English only.

**PDFsharp.Shared**  
Code that grants friendly access to all PDFsharp Foundation assemblies lives in this new assembly.

**Bug in parsing object referenced**  
Lexer now supports white-space within object references.

**Page orientation now works as expected**  
The connection between page Width, Height, PageOrientation, and PageRotation was weird.
It was replaced by a consistent concept.
This is a breaking change.
